<h2> Salon Policies</h2>
<p> Please be compassionate in remembering we are an appointment-preferred salon.
   This means we reserve only enough time for you. We require 24 hour notice when canceling your appointment,
  so our stylists can find a replacement, and maintain their income and livelihood.
  We reserve the right to charge the price of a missed appointment.
  Thanks for your help and understanding and keeping us in business and our stylists working.
</p>

<h2> Children </h2>
<p>Our goal is to ensure your child’s safety and to provide an environment in which
  our technicians can focus completely on each of their clients.
Children are not permitted in the service area unless they are receiving a service themselves.
For guests of the salon that must bring their children we offer an unsupervised children’s room.
Unfortunately we are not able to offer the use of this room to guests receiving spa services due
to it being unsupervised and the parent being unable to attend to the child’s needs.
